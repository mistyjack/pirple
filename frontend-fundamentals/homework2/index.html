        <h1>Pounded Yam Recipe</h1> <!-- Heading -->
        
        <!-- Food description -->
        <p>Pounded yam is a solid kind of food eaten in Nigeria. It's made from 
        yam and molded into somewhat eliptical or spherical shape. I like it 
        because of its texture and it's very sweet.</p>
